i code for fun, if you're writing something beautiful - reach out  

**stack:**  
`neovim` - code and notes  
`go`, `shell languages` - tools  
`fish`, `bash` - i use the former, script for the latter  
`python` - great learning tool for non-language-specific problems  

**web development:**  
a complicated field i've spent a bit of time in. i've tried and learned a few things:  
`go` - backend. i opt for extending `pocketbase` for simple projects  
`sveltekit` - frontend framework, for complex projects  
`htmx`, `alpine.js` - simple projects
`react` and `preact` - i know a bit of it
`react native` - a cross-platform solution
