**stack:**  
`neovim` - code and notes  
`go`, `zig` - tools  
`zig`, `c` - low level  
`bash` - its way better than anything else i've used when paired with [ble.sh](https://github.com/akinomyoga/ble.sh)  
`lua` - for [anything it can possibly do](https://if-not-nil.github.io/no-the-moon/) with or without custom c libraries  
`godot`, `zig`, `lua` - gamedev  

**web:**  
`go` - backend  
`svelte` - for complex things  
`htmx`, `alpine.js` - for simple ones  
`react` and `preact` - when it's not my project  
`react native` - cross-platform
